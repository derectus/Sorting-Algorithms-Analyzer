# Visual-Sort-Algorithms-Analyzer

Comparison of Heapsort, Quicksort(FirstElement, RandomElement, MidOfFirstMidLastElement), Dual Pivot QuickSort and Introsort

In the HeapSort, implemented a max heap to sort given array.

In the QuickSort, implemented three different ways of choosing the pivot ( pivotType), and as given below.

1.  FirstElement : The pivot is always the first element of the array to be sorted.    
2.  RandomElement : The pivot is chosen at random from any element in the array to be sorted.   
3.  MidOfFirstMidLastElement : The pivot is an element whose value is in the middle among the {first, middle, last} elements in the array to be sorted.
    
In the Dual Pivot QuickSort, implemented a different version of quicksort.

In the IntroSort, implemented a hybrid sorting algorithm. Heap Sort and Quick Sort algorithms should be used while writing this sorting method.

# Running Time Computation

The program offers you some options. Such as, the scenario of the index to be scanned (Equal Integers, Integers, Increasing Integers, Decreasing Integers), the size of the array (1000, 10000, 10000).
